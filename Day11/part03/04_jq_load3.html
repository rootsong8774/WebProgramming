                <p>We can't wait to load up Barney, our faithful bus, with the widest range of toys we've ever taken on
                    the road...

                    This year sees some impressive stats as we will be bringing 15 team members, 50km of cable, 50
                    arduino compatible
                    boards, 25 laptops, 20 tablets, 10 mobile phones, 5 quadcopter kits, and a giant laser strapped to
                    the roof.

                    We're also bringing a big top, which will provide shelter throughout the night as well as hosting
                    talks and
                    demonstrations from an impressive range of guest speakers.

                    And yes, we did say that we have a giant laser strapped to the roof of the bus. Let's see how often
                    we get stopped for
                    speeding this time!</p>

                <p>Our new generator is so hefty we have to tow it on a dedicated trailer, but that's worth it because
                    we're powering
                    bigger projects than ever and we expect you to be tinkering throughout the night with our 24-hour
                    maker-jams.</p>

                <p>Our state of the art 3D printer is ready to help you take your own souvenirs home! The only catch is
                    that you have to
                    design them. We'll add each one to our open-source 3D designs library, and the designer of the best
                    one gets to keep the
